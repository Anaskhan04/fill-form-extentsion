# AutoForm Pro 🚀

**AutoForm Pro** is a powerful, privacy-focused browser extension that automates filling out web forms. Unlike standard autofillers, it uses intelligent fuzzy matching to detect fields even when they don't have standard names, and it supports custom user profiles for different contexts (e.g., Personal, Work, Shopping).

## ✨ Features

- **Smart Field Detection**: Uses fuzzy logic to identify fields like "First Name", "ZIP Code", "Job Title", etc., even if the website uses non-standard labels.
- **Context-Aware**: Distinguishes between similar fields (e.g., "Address Line 1" vs "Address Line 2").
- **Radio & Checkbox Support**: Intelligently handles "Yes/No" questions, Gender selections, and Terms & Conditions.
- **Multiple Profiles**: Create and switch between unlimited profiles (e.g., "Anas - Student", "Anas - Developer").
- **Privacy First**: All data is stored locally on your device. Nothing is sent to the cloud.
- **Instant Control**:
  - Right-click context menu: **"AutoFill Now"**
  - Keyboard Shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+L` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+L` (Mac)
  - **Clear Fields** button to instantly reset a form.
